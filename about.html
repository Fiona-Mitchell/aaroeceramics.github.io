<h1>Ingrid Aaroe</h1>
<p>
I worked in graphics for several years before discovering clay, which has been my passion since 2009. My inspiration comes from the natural world and I find beauty in simple shapes and forms.<br>
I was brought up in a Scandinavian-American family and spent many years living in Japan and Hong Kong.  My utilitarian approach to designing ceramics is strongly influenced by the Japanese and Scandinavian aesthetic.<br> 
My handmade functional ceramics are simple and easy to live with. I love it when people tell me they use and enjoy them in their daily life.<br>
